You must have come across vectors and matrices before (although no in depth knowledge is required). __No previous programming knowledge is required__. This excercise aims to be self contained so you should be able to jump right in without any prior reading. You are however encouraged to use google as you go through the excercises to help you understand/find syntax. \n",
