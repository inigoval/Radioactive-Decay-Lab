# Modelling Radioactive Decay Using Python 3
### Written by Inigo Val

In this lab, we will be using the programming language Python 3 to create a model simulating the radioactive decay of a number of particles over time.

In order to complete this lab you should be comfortable with exponential decay and half lives. You must have come across vectors and matrices before (although no in depth knowledge is required). __No previous programming knowledge is required__. This excercise aims to be self contained so you should be able to jump right in without any prior reading. You are however encouraged to use google as you go through the excercises to help you understand/find syntax. 

We will mainly be using the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) _package_ which provides a powerful framework for numerical computations in Python. We will also use the [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/) to visualise some of our results.

All excercises _without_ asterisks should be completed; tasks _with_ asterisks are extensions and are usually more exploratory. These can be omitted until you have finished all other tasks.

#### In order to use this notebook, you will have to [clone the repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) to your computer first. Make sure to do this in an empty folder.
